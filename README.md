# weather_prediction
In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location.
Project Overview
In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location. Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. We'll build a system to make historical predictions. Then, we'll add more predictors to improve the model. We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.

Data
We'll download our dataset from NOAA, a US government agency. You can follow these instructions to download the data:

Go to NOAA Search
Enter the years you want data for (I recommend starting with 1970), and search for the closest airport to you.

Click add to cart on the airport you want.
If there is no airport near you, try your city or country name instead.

Go to the cart
Select the csv format and click continue.

Select all of the checkboxes for data types.

Enter your email and click continue.

You'll get an email with a link to download the data.

Make sure to take a look at the data documentation as well.
